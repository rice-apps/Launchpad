# Launchpad
Hello! You can find a collection of our Launchpad introductory projects here. If you'd like to see the Learning Program, check it out [here](https://www.notion.so/riceapps/Launchpad-Learning-Plan-c2eb45d2a49c4479be4e6139013272d0).

## Projects
### Starter Project
This is the first project that you will complete as part of RiceApps' Launchpad Program. The learning goals from this project are to acquire familiarity with HTML, CSS, and React, as well as start to dabble in more advanced React concepts like `useState`.

The reference code can be found under the folder `starter-project`, or you can navigate to it by clicking [here](https://github.com/rice-apps/Launchpad/tree/main/starter-project).

### Starter Project v2
In this next project, we continue to build onto our initial Starter Project with more advanced React tools and tricks -- concepts including `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and routing (using React Router v6) are covered here for a comprehensive introduction to the deeper aspects of web development. 

Reference code will be posted shortly for this project.

### TBD
More coming soon!
